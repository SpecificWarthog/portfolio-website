      <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
      <p>
        This project investigates whether Bitcoin has become a more effective hedge against inflation
        compared with gold, particularly following the approval of US spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024.
        Using Bloomberg data, the analysis applied a combination of static regressions, structural
        dummy-interaction models and 60-day rolling regressions to capture both short-term and evolving
        relationships between asset returns and inflation measures. A manually constructed CPI surprise
        variable was incorporated to sharpen the identification of inflation shocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The results show that Bitcoin’s inflation sensitivity is increasing, most notably with respect to
        breakeven inflation expectations. Rolling regressions indicate that Bitcoin’s beta to breakevens
        has trended upward post-ETF approval, suggesting a gradual structural shift. However, Bitcoin
        still reacts poorly to sharp upside inflation surprises, often behaving like a high-beta risk
        asset vulnerable to rate shocks. Gold, by contrast, remains broadly stable, showing its
        traditional role as a defensive long-term hedge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, the findings suggest that while Bitcoin should not be viewed as a direct replacement for
        gold, it has potential as a tactical complement, particularly in environments where inflation
        expectations are rising steadily rather than spiking.

        <h3>IPO: India’s Poor Offering?</h3>
        <p>
          Swiggy, the food delivery app giant, is set to go public this Wednesday with a $1.3 billion IPO,
          but the excitement may be lukewarm (FT, 2024). Joining a surge of Indian companies looking to
          capitalise on public offerings, Swiggy represents a market that some analysts say is running on
          fumes. Swiggy is merely the latest to join the fray, following Hyundai’s underwhelming $3.3 billion IPO,
          the largest in Asia this year, which has struggled due to perceived overvaluation and slowing EV sales.
          Even early backers Tencent and Accel have decided to cash out now, perhaps signalling their own caution.

        <p>
          The question looms: is Swiggy’s IPO a microcosm of larger economic issues? The Nifty index recently fell,
          as seen below, with a record-breaking $11.2 billion outflow from Indian equities in October (FT, 2024).
          Investors seem to be in search of ‘fine China’, where a new $1.4 trillion stimulus was announced, or are
          holding cash to navigate volatility post-U.S. election.

        <h3>Inflation’s sticky wicket</h3>
        <p>
          Weakening demand is evident across corporate India, as sluggish earnings and Goldman Sachs’ equity downgrade
          from ‘overweight’ to ‘neutral’ suggest. Meanwhile, inflation remains stubbornly high at 6%, but the Reserve
          Bank of India (RBI) has been reluctant to cut interest rates from 6.5% with governor Shaktikanta Das
          cautioning it is too risky for an imminent rate cut (FT, 2024). Unlike India’s cricket obsession, where
          hitting 6s is revered, the RBI would be wise to aim closer to the inflation target of 4, to ensure
          middle-class spending power isn’t excessively eroded.
        </p>

        <h3>Credit no longer where it’s due</h3>
        <p>
          The RBI’s recent retail credit crackdown might be hitting the economy’s backbone, the middle class, who once
          drove India’s rally with aspirational spending. This demographic previously fuelled India’s economic rally,
          ploughing household savings and bank deposits into capital markets, but now finds itself squeezed by stricter
          lending criteria, with delinquencies set to rise by 30-50 basis points by March 2025 (FT, 2024). The rupee’s
          recent plunge and foreign stock ownership hitting a 12-year low beckons an overreliance on domestic investors
          to support markets; support they lack the capacity to offer.
        </p>

        <h3>Swiggy might be ‘Gettin’ Jiggy wit it’</h3>
        <p>
          Following casualties of similar players like Uber Eats and Dunzo, Swiggy’s future in an ‘uber-competitive’
          market (pun intended) is uncertain, but with rising smartphone usage and expanding infrastructure, it might
          still have a chance to become India’s next IPO ‘biggie’. It has the right elements to succeed, even if
          broader economic forces seem to be stacked against it.
        </p>

        <h3>End of the Innings, Is India a Sell?</h3>
        <p>
          With inflation stubbornly high, demand weakening, and foreign capital flowing out, India’s economic ‘boom’
          may be about to bomb. While Swiggy’s IPO reflects the country’s entrepreneurial spirit, it also raises
          questions about whether India’s economy has the resilience to support ambitious growth amid these pressures.
          Even if the RBI cuts interest rates, it may not be enough to shore up confidence or spark a lasting rally.
        </p>
        <p>
          The takeaway? Investors seem to be ‘out’ on India, not ‘in,’ and unless deeper challenges are addressed,
          India may find itself bowled out in the global economic game.

        <h3>Emerging Markets: A Fragile Renaissance?</h3>
        <p>
          Falling US interest rates and China’s pro-growth stimulus have sparked renewed optimism for
          emerging markets (EM). However, beneath this surface-level revival lie potential headwinds
          that warrant cautious consideration.
        </p>

        <h3>US Interest Rates and the Rally in Emerging Market Debt</h3>
        <p>
          Federal rate cuts are a double-edged sword for emerging markets. This long-awaited cut comes amid
          a relatively healthy US economy, stimulating 'animal spirits' and encouraging risk taking.
        </p>

        <figure>
          <img src={emFig1} alt="Fed Funds Rate vs EM debt flows" />
          <figcaption>(FRED, 2024; IMF, 2023)</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          As shown in the chart above, the relationship between the Fed Funds Rate (in orange) and EM debt
          flows (in green) demonstrates a clear inverse pattern as falling rates lower government bond yields,
          making higher-yielding EM debt more attractive. For instance, after the GFC, when the Fed slashed rates,
          debt flows to EMs increased, affirming that lower rates encourage risk-taking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Local currency bonds depend not just on lower US rates but also on a weaker dollar. With the US Dollar
          Index up 3.67% last month (CNBC, 2024), this assumption is challenged. A stronger dollar erodes the
          benefits of US rate cuts by making EM debt less attractive to international investors, who typically
          measure returns in dollars.
        </p>
        <p>
          The real challenge for EMs is converting inflows into long-term stability. Asian economies have built
          strong local currency bond markets with often under 5% of government debt denominated in US dollars.
          Compare this with Argentina at 55% which makes it highly sensitive to currency depreciation and
          interest rate shifts. This contrast highlights that while falling US rates may temporarily boost EM inflows,
          those without strong local currency markets remain vulnerable to external shocks.
        </p>

        <h3>China’s Unsteady Stimulus</h3>
        <p>
          Beijing’s stimulus fuelled a surge in Chinese equities, with $40bn in inflows to China equity funds in
          the first week of this month, according to EPFR (Financial Times, 2024). These measures aim to boost
          consumption and sustain demand for raw materials, benefiting EM suppliers. The outcome? EM debt funds have
          also seen their longest run of inflows in over a year. However, China’s property sector still faces
          deep-rooted structural issues, raising doubts about whether this wave of optimism will lead to long-term growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Akin to South Korea’s reforms in the 1990s to reduce dependence on chaebols (conglomerates), China needs
          to shift from short-term boosts to deeper structural reforms. Until then, the spillover effects on EMs
          will remain shaky at best, built on fragile foundations.
        </p>

        <h3>The Beautiful Word that is ‘Tariff’</h3>
        <p>
          The ‘Elephant in the Room’ in this EM rally is the looming return of Donald Trump. Recently, he declared,
          “To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff,” underscoring his preference for aggressive
          trade barriers with proposed tariffs including a 20% levy on imports.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such tariffs could drive US inflation, prompting the Fed to tighten policy again. Rising US rates would
          divert capital flows to safer US assets, raising borrowing costs for EM countries. UBS estimates that a
          Republican sweep, could lead to an 11% decline in the MSCI EM stocks index by 2025 end (Financial Times, 2024)
          reversing recent gains in both EM equities and debt.
        </p>
        <p>
          The previous US-China trade war under Trump offers a glimpse into what might unfold. We see it as imperative
          that EMs are proactive to diversify trade partnerships, such as the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA)
          signed in 2019, rather than relying on favourable geopolitical outcomes.
        </p>

        <h3>The Road Ahead</h3>
        <p>
          We wish to assert that this moment of optimism shouldn’t lead to complacency. Instead, it should be a wake-up
          call for EMs to tackle their vulnerabilities. In a world where the next rate hike or trade war could erase gains,
          the true winners will be those prioritising long-term resilience over short-term gains.
